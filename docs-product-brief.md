# PromptForge – Product Brief

## Product idea
PromptForge is a focused workspace for turning fuzzy goals into clear prompts via two main experiences:

- A **Fast & Easy** flow (the default) where users describe a problem in their own words (typed or voice). The app can ask a few clarifying questions and then proposes ready-to-use prompt variants that the user can refine.
- An **Enchanted** sandbox where users intentionally choose templates and settings, shaping and testing prompt recipes with more control.

Both flows share the same underlying template, history, and preference system so users can move between quick help and deep customization.

## Target users
- Makers and founders writing product specs, strategies, and pitches
- Developers generating coding prompts and debugging requests
- Marketers creating ads, landing copy, and email sequences
- Writers and creators shaping outlines, scripts, and story prompts
- Teams that want consistent prompt quality and shared standards

## Core promise
Fast clarity and consistent quality. The app reduces prompt-writing friction, enforces structure, and improves outcomes with lightweight guidance—without feeling heavy or complicated.

## Key concepts
- **Fast & Easy flow**: default entry point where users describe a problem (text or voice), optionally answer clarifying questions, and receive several ready-to-use prompt variants with room for refinement.
- **Enchanted sandbox**: a more advanced, structured space where users choose templates, fields, and options to shape prompts deliberately.
- **Templates**: reusable prompt blueprints (private and shareable).
- **Fields (variables)**: role, audience, tone, constraints, format, examples.
- **Live preview**: instant prompt assembly as fields change.
- **Validation**: required fields, missing info warnings, gentle quality checks.
- **History**: saved generations with inputs for later reuse.
- **User preferences & profile**: lightweight information (e.g., typical tone, audiences, domains) that helps personalize defaults and recommendations.
- **Autocomplete for task input (later)**: optional AI-assisted suggestions while typing a problem description to reduce friction.
- **Voice typing effect**: UI animation that makes dictated input feel like it’s being typed in real time.

## Primary flows
1. **Fast & Easy (default)**: Describe a problem (typed or voice) → app may ask a few clarifying questions → user receives several prompt candidates → refine and copy/export.
2. **Enchanted sandbox**: Choose or create a template → define fields and options → preview and test → reuse in Generator.
3. Reuse from history: pick a past generation → duplicate, tweak, copy.
4. Share templates via a public gallery.

## Core screens
- Landing
- Fast & Easy surface (can be implemented as an enhanced Task Helper + quick preview).
- Enchanted workspace composed of:
  - Template Builder (split view for fields + prompt/preview).
  - Generator (calm flow for filling fields and seeing the final prompt).
- Gallery
- Dashboard (optional overview tying flows together)
- History (searchable with quick reuse)

## Design principles
- Minimalist, calm, and distraction-free
- Speed first: generate → copy is always one click away
- Guided, not bossy
- Trustworthy and predictable
- Delight through details: microcopy, spacing, shortcuts, and polish
